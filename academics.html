	<p>This year, I've performed Pride and Prejudice and produced a schoolwide talent show with my Acting class. I've also visited the Columbia Journalism Conference with my journalism class. At the same time, I've had the worst ever case of Senioritis, which has resulted in more missing assignments than I've had in all my other years of highschool combined. </p>
